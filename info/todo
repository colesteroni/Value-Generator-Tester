* TODO *

* Part 1 *

* Improve seed handler
* Basic unit tests -> make sure filler distance function is accurate, oscillation function
* Global dictionary that is set w/in generator for values that can be affected w/ seed
* Dev tools for analyzing filler blocks and update other dev tools
* Document functions? or make more readable

* Part 2 * Will be done more slowly so I have time for other projects *

* Parser to chose the generator object to test in command line
* Much more tools to analyze maps
* Add secondary pivotal cache since x_length - 1 * y_length - 1 blocks will be using the same 4 pivotals each time
* Make more modular (do a lot of refactoring)
* Make code very readable w/out need for comments !!!
* Improve usability
* Make hard for error to occur by way program is designed
* Make better use of the language
* Implement more efficient data structures
* Change when pivotals are pre-generated
* Empty pivotal cache periodically

* Part 3 * To be done when better ideas come about *

* Find ways to grow project
