* TODO * * Items not in order, just parts
* Part 1 *
* Fix x_length and y_length interpreting
* Refactor generator, map, cell to make more efficient
* Better oscillating function - currently all rare values stuck around (0, 0)
* Render rest of blocks other than pivotal
* Dynamic FPS
* Make player & add movement code to it

* Part 2 *
* Add secondary pivotal cache since x_length - 1 * y_length - 1 blocks will be using the same 4 pivotals each time
* Make more modular
* Make code very readable w/out need for comments
* More intuitive
* Make hard for error to occur by way program & data structures are designed
* Make better use of the language
* Make more efficient
* Implement more efficient data structures
* Change when pivotals are pregenerated
* Empty pivotal pre-generated periodically

* Part 3 *
* Find way to make awesome
