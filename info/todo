* TODO * * Items not in order, just parts

* Part 1 *

* Better oscillating function - currently all rare values stuck around (0, 0)
* Render filler(non-pivotal) blocks
* Improve seed handler
* Interchangeable generators
* Comparative generation functions
* Unit test manager
* Basic unit tests

* Part 2 * Come back after working on more projects and then improve this one with newly learned skills & fresh view *

* Add secondary pivotal cache since x_length - 1 * y_length - 1 blocks will be using the same 4 pivotals each time
* Make more modular (do a lot of refactoring)
* Make code very readable w/out need for comments !!!
* Improve usability
* Make hard for error to occur by way program is designed
* Make better use of the language
* Implement more efficient data structures
* Change when pivotals are pre-generated
* Empty pivotal cache periodically

* Part 3 * To be done when better ideas come about *

* Find ways to grow project
