The seed gets applied in the generator
To set the seed for a map, create a generator object with seed=Seed(Hex only) and pass it as an argument to the map
at hand with generator=your_generator.

* The seed should be a string so I can slice it easily :) *

The generator works in chunks meaning it applies a set formula with weights determined by the seed to blocks within a
set perimeter before it loops. This means there will be identical chunks of land every so often so it is important that
you set the generator.x_mod and generator.y_mod variables to be high enough for this looping to not interfere with your
project(?).


* Seed index uses *
Last 4 numbers determine the size of the rectangle that the formula will be applied to. Last 2 for Y, other 2 for X(HEX)
