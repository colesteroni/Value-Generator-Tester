# Map-Engine
Cell based map engine with pseudo-random terrain generation. Uses Python 3.6 and PyGame 1.9. This is meant to be a starting point for a python game. I created this mainly to practice git and teach myself more about pseudo-randomness. I am also trying to learn to program in a way that my code is more readable so pardon my lack of comments.
